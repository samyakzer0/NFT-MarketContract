# NFT Marketplace on Ethereum

## Description

This is a decentralized NFT Marketplace built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The platform allows users to mint, buy, sell, and trade NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) securely and transparently. Each NFT follows the ERC-721 standard, ensuring compatibility with popular wallets like MetaMask and other decentralized applications (dApps).

## Features

- **Minting NFTs**: Users can mint their own NFTs.
- **Buying and Selling NFTs**: Users can list their NFTs for sale and other users can purchase them.
- **Marketplace Fees**: The platform can take a small percentage from sales as a marketplace fee.
- **Auction System**: NFTs can be put up for auction, and bids can be placed by users.
- **Wallet Integration**: The platform connects with MetaMask or any web3 wallet.
- **Ethereum Network**: Deployed on the Ethereum network, ensuring decentralization and immutability.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (or yarn)
- Hardhat or Truffle (for smart contract deployment)
- MetaMask (for interacting with the dApp)
- Solidity (for writing the smart contract)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-marketplace
   cd nft-marketplace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile the smart contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. **Deploy the contract on the Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia)**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

## Smart Contract

The NFT Marketplace contract is written in Solidity and follows the ERC-721 standard for NFTs.

### Contract Structure

- **ERC721**: Inherits from the OpenZeppelin ERC-721 implementation.
- **Marketplace**: Handles the listing and buying of NFTs.
- **Auction**: Allows NFTs to be auctioned and bids to be placed.
